# Motivational Meme Generator

## Overview of the project
In this project a "meme generator" is built â€“ a multimedia application to
dynamically generate memes, including an image with an overlaid quote.

The "meme generator" loads quotes from a variety of filetypes (PDF,
Word Documents, CSVs, Text files) and generates memes by loading, manipulating
and saving images. Dynamic user input through a command-line tool and a web
service is possible.

## Seeting up and running the program
